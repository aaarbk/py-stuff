            **Digit-based problems**

Programming problems on the digits of integers can be solved by

- converting the integer to a string, or
- using arithmetic operators such as integer division, `//` and remainder, `%` to extract digits and pare the number down.

Here's the simplest possible example, one that prints the digits of the number backwards, one by one:

~~~
def printDigits(n):
  while n > 0:
    d = n % 10
    print(d)
    n //= 10
~~~
