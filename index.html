            **Digit-based problems**

Programming problems on the digits of integers can be solved by

1. converting the integer to a string, or
2. using arithmetic operators such as integer division, `//` and remainder, `%` to extract digits and pare the number down.

Method 1 allows one to use string indexing and slicing to extract the digits and manipulate them. For example, if `n = 1234`, and taking `m = str(n)` we have:

- `m[0]` => `'1'`, giving us the leading digit
- `m[-1]` => `'4'`, giving us the trailing digit
- `m[::-2]` => `'4321'` is number-string reversed, etc.

Bear in mind that the result of the above operations is a string again (Python doesn't  magically  convert it back to an integer just  because they  happen to be digits), so typically you would want to convert the result back to an integer when you're done.

Method 2 is the one you really need to be familiar with. In simplest terms, given an integer `n`:
1. `n % 10` lets us extract the last digit (`1234%10` => `4`)
2. `n // 10` gives us what remains when the last digit is chopped off (`1234//10` => `123`)
3. Do the above two steps in a loop (as explained below) and you can process the entire number digit by digit starting at the end.

If you have trouble remembering these operations, use this analogy:
Suppose you wanted to pay someone $1230, and you only had 10 dollar bank notes. (But you had as many of them as you like, for the sake of the analogy!) So you could pay them the exact amount by handing them 123 notes, after which you owe them nothing. This is basically saying that `1230 // 10 = 123` and `1230 % 10 = 0`. 

What if you had owed them $1234? Well, now you still hand them 123 notes, paying them a total of $1230, but now you still owe them $4. This is saying that `1234 // 10 = 123` and `1234 % 10 = 4`.

Of course, in the tutorial here we're dealing with chopping up digits, but this analogy transfers over directly because we work in base-10 (corresponding to our usage of 10 dollar notes).

Here's the simplest possible example, one that prints the digits of the number backwards, one by one:

~~~
def printDigits(n):
  while n > 0:
    d = n % 10
    print(d)
    n //= 10
~~~

The basic pattern here is 

~~~
while n > 0: # as long as there are digits remaining
  d = n % 10 # get the last digit
  # ... do something with it
  # ...
  n //= 10 # chop the last digit off

~~~

The chopping process makes the number smaller and the loop stops when `n` becomes 0. (We're assuming `n` was a positive `int` to begin with.)

Also notice that the loop runs as many times as there are digits. This gives us a simple way to count digits:

~~~
def digitCount(n):
  count = 0
  while n > 0:
    d = n % 10
    count += 1
    n //= 10
  return count
~~~

Here's how we would sum up all the digits:

~~~
def digitSum(n):
  sum = 0
  while n > 0:
    d = n % 10
    sum += d
    n //= 10
  return sum
~~~

So passing in 1234 as input should return 10 (=1+2+3+4).

Let's write a function that returns `True` if a certain digit `x` is in the given positive integer `d`, and `False` otherwise. We're using the same pattern as before, what's new is that we inspect every digit we chop off and compare it with `x`. As soon as we find a match (if at all), we can return `True`. But only after having seen all the digits in the number (corresponding to the loop having finished) can we return `False`.

~~~
def digitPresent(n, x):
  while n > 0:
    d = n % 10
    if d == x:
      return True
    n //= 10
  
  # If execution reaches this point, then the digit wasn't found
  return True
~~~

Notice that we can conveniently work with the digits from right to left but not the other way around. One can write a helper that first reverses a number and then works on the digits of the reversed number from right to left. This is effectively like working on the original number from the leftmost digit forward. However, writing this function is a bit more complex; we need to build up a new number `m` as we decimate `n`.
